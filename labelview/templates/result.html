        <div class="title">About the label</div>
        <p>European Union regulations on organic farming are designed to provide a clear structure for the production of organic goods across the whole of the EU. This is to satisfy consumer demand for trustworthy organic products whilst providing a fair
            marketplace for producers, distributors and marketers. Anyone within the European Union who wants to call their products "organic," "ecological" or "from controlled organic cultivation" has been required to use the EU organic seal since July
            1, 2010. It identifies products or produce that originate from organic farming and whose producers or processors comply with the criteria for organic farming as defined by EU law. Those who comply with even stricter standards can additionally
            use other organic labels.</p>
